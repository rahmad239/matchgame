        <p>Memory or Match Maker (as we like to call it) is a card game designed to help
        improve memory. All cards start face down, at each turn a player is to turn
        two cards face up in an attempt to reveal two matching cards. The object of 
        the game is to reveal all matches.</p>
    <h2>Match Making Twist</h2>
        <p>Unlike traditional match games, this one will require you to be cupid and match power couples. This game was 
        a fun challenge for me and gave me a chance to learn more about coding logical sequence of operation, DOM manipulation and a few CSS tricks.
        The couples who are on the cards have all made an impact both individualy and
        within thier partnership that has impressed me.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
