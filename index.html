    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>Memory or Match Maker (as we like to call it) is a card game designed to help
        improve memory. All cards start face down, at each turn a player is to turn
        two cards face up in an attempt to reveal two matching cards. The object of 
        the game is to reveal all matches.</p>

    <h2>Match Making Twist</h2>
        <p>Unlike traditional match games, this one will require you to match power couples.
        This was an excersice for me of taking note of couple that have made in impact on me and 
        the way I percieve my abilities as an individual and within a partnership. 
        <a id="profile"href="www.linkedin.com/in/rahmad239">I</a> am a sprouting developer and this game reminded me of the power we have as creators in
        our craft and the power of combinining with other powerful people. This game was FUN!
        My goal is to experience the excitement and love for learning coding as I am building 
        my skill set in it.
